cl-digraph focuses on simplicity, correctness, and usability.  Performance is
not *terrible*, but is not a high priority.

It is currently not thread-safe, but this may happen in the future.

The test suite currently passes in SBCL, CCL, ECL, and ABCL on OS X and Debian.
Further testing is welcome.
